# Vio-Helper
Use nodejs, mongodb, react and web audio API to tune, compose/play scores and offer a real-time friendly apporach to improve playing the correct pitches

## TODO
Too many things, just list those I think of
* refactor UI, there are bad react patterns
* synthesize the audio as real instruments, at least piano
* analyze the audio more accurately.
